# Brians BIS 15L Repository
# About Me:
:sparkles: Hello, Hola, Oi! I'm a UC Davis Post-Bacc student who hopes this repository finds you well.
What once started as a blank slate repository will soon be one filled with countless projects, curiosities, and new discoveries during my time in BIS 15L at UC Davis. Join me on this ride. Happy to have you here. :sparkles:
